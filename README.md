## How to Build Project on Heruko
The First thing you have to do is to go onto Heruko and create a new project. Than you need go to the deploy tab and select link to github. Make sure before you do this that you have forked the project so that it will saved as a repository on your github.

Once Heroku is connected to your github, you will able to search for the specific repository, the one you will be looking for is this one, "info2300-jba3", unless you have renamed the repository, then look for the name you changed it to.
