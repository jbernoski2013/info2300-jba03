## Description
This is an online resume HTML Page. It can be used as a template, or for my personal use to send to future employers. 
## Installation

## How to Build Project on Heruko
The First thing I did on Heruko was create a new project. I than went to the deploy tab and selected to link to github, as that is where I currently have my project being saved on.

Once I had Heroku connected to my github, I was able to search for the specific repository, the one I was looking for is this one, "info2300-jba3".

Lastly, I had to go in and click on "Deploy Branch". Once it went through and was successful it generated a live version of my page.
